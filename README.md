# DBDTimer

**If you aren't able to run the program try installing the newest version of java [here](https://java.com/en/download/).**

**Otherwise, try fixing the java path by following [this](https://java.com/en/download/help/path.html) tutorial.**

## Introduction
This program simply allows you to create timers to allow you to get know timings of perks, add-ons and items.

HOW TO RUN: 
  1. Install Visual Studio Code.
  2. Install the latest version of Java JRE (I installed the SDK from Adoptium version 21).
  3. In VS Code Install Java Extension Pack.
  4. Download the source code of this github repo.
  5. Extract if needed and open project folder in VS Code.
  6. Click Run at the top left bar and "Run Without Debugging".
  7. Keybinds should work now as long as the program is running in the background.
  8. Ctrl + C in the terminal to stop the program.



## Customization
There is total customization within the settings manager.

You can create or edit existing timers with:
* Custom images
* Custom times (start at X, CountUp/CountDown)
* Custom blinkers (change colour at X time)
* Custom binds (timer 1 = X, timer 2 = Y)

You can change the properties of these timers: 
* Custom icon size (64 - 192px)
* Custom icon inactive colour
* Custom icon positioning (Drag & Drop)
* Custom fonts and font size
* Custom Reset and Hide icons binds

## Presets
Presets come pre-installed with 4 timers for each killer and survivor.

Killer:
* Decisive Strike timer (how long until survivors DS runs out)
* Borrowed Time timer (how long until survivors borrowed runs out)
* Chase timer (how long youve been chasing a survivor)
* On Shoulder timer (how long until survivor wiggles off)

Survivor: 
* Chase timer (how long you've been getting chased)
* Hook Stage timer (how long until next hook stage)
* Generator timer (how long until the generator is completed)
* Unbreakable timer (how long until you get up)

As mentioned these can be edited, removed or added to by the user using the settings manager.
